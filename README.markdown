I'm completing the [JavaScript Koans developed by David Lang](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans).

This is part of a mentoring process in my job at [Surge](http://www.surgeforward.com), so while you're welcome to take a look - please consider all of this to be "Learning Process" code.

### Acknowledgements
*  Dick Wall (the Java posse) - for bringing the idea of koans to my attention
*  Edgecase - for the great Ruby Koans
*  Douglas Crockford - for Javascript; the good bits
